# Boxes
## Box Dimensions( width, height)
### By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.
### The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.
### When you use percentages, the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window or, if the box is encased within another box, it is a percentage of the size of the containing box.
### When you use ems, the size of the box is based on the size of text within it. Designers have recently started to use percentages and ems more for measurements as they try to create designs that are flexible across devices which have different-sized screens.

## Limiting Width (min-width, max-width)
### Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.
## Limitig Height (min-height, max-height)
### In the same way that you might want to limit the width of a box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it. This is achieved using the min-height and max-height properties.
## Overflowing Content
## overflow
### The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
### *hidden*: This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
### *scroll*: This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.

## Border, Margin & Padding
### Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
